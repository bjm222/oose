### Project comments we noticed during presentation:

Interesting Features of the project:

	-Statistics of the event will be shown like FB
	-Tell where people are in campus to plan the event effectively
	-Multimedia support for notifications unlike the plain text mail
	-Nice Rich text editor for Web Portal. If time permits, it should be extended to Android as well.

Changes in UI:

	-Make only one page with combined fields, do not segregate based on requirement of the field.
	-Add recommendation based on text filled by the user
	-When the event is declined, does the user get a reason or a notification? Please add this feature to help the organizer.
